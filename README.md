# MarvelSearch

Small project for studing purpose

## Improvements

- We could have a request configuration classe/struct to better organize the code
- We could have the CharacterCell to implement a protocol, so the code would be more testable and decoupled
- The first page of the search is being duplicated. I don't know why yet
